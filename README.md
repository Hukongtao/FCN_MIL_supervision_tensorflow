The Fully Convolutional Network for Image Segmentatation Implementation by Pakhomov (2017) was used as starting point.

https://github.com/warmspringwinds/tf-image-segmentation

An implemetation of MIL was made based on this implementation by changing the loss function in tf_image_segmentation/utils/tarining_weak.py

To use the new loss function, the scrips are also changed. Some additional code for working with the PascalVOC data is also included.
